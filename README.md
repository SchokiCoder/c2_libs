# C2 Libraries

Please see [C2Lang.org](http://c2lang.org) for more info about C2!

## Info
This repository is needed by both the C++ based C2-compiler
(https://github.com/c2lang/c2compiler) and the C2 based C2-compiler
(https://github.com/c2lang/c2c_native)

The C2_LIBDIR Environment variable should point to this repository, so
that the C2 compiler can find it.
